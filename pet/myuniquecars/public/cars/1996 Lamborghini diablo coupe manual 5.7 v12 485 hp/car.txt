Name: Lamborghini diablo
Price: 360,000AUD
Year: 1996
Location: Melbourne
Desc:The price is 360k AUD landed and complied, including the vehicle, shipping, taxes, and compliance. All you need to do is pay for registration, roadworthy/pits/blueslip, and stamp/transfer duty.

The vehicle can be shipped from Hong Kong to any state in Australia, but I would prefer it to come to Melbourne for compliance, as that is where I am located.
